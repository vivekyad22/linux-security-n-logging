SECURITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing psacct or acct Packages
Lockdown Cronjobs
Disable Ctrl+Alt+Delete in Inittab
Ignore ICMP or Broadcast Request
Changing Public ports
Implement fail2ban to Ban Malicious IP Addresses
Maldet for malware attacks
IDS Tripwire - detect when files changed on system
logwatch install for email logs
Prevent rootkit by installing (rkhunter), and chkrootkit
providing rshell to users
Enable ExecShield
Minimizing C & C++ programming defects like buffer overflows & removing it by Address space layout randomization
One of the ExecShield memory-management techniques is using random memory locations each time a program is started. Using random memory locations prevents worms or viruses from knowing which parts of memory to overwrite with executables that breach the security of the system. 
Limit amount of processes in /etc/security/limits.conf , hard & soft nproc
